I. Requirements:
	Project 4 requires the implementation of a distributed Passport Office.

	Part 1 required the Passport Office to run using the new network system calls from project 3. This meant some significant refactoring and some minor changes to the passport office design.

	Part2 required the use of multiple servers. The client or passport office was to have no knowledge of the various servers. All servers would coordinate with eachother to properly handle requests. When a request comes into the server the server can handle the request if it owns the resource otherwise, it will forward the request to all other servers and handle the responses.

II. Assumptions:
	Assumption 1: Each instance has a unique machine id supplied with the -m argument.
	Assumption 2: The servers are always machine id 0-4 and any clients are 5 and up.
	Assumption 3: The necessary changes have been made to the machine directory to allow for use of the standard template library. These changes were approved by Professor Crowley.

III. Design:
	Passport Office:
		Most of the differences in the passport office code are changes to the ways the monitor variables are accessed. Before, the MVs were not system calls. Now, a simple increment to a MV requires a Get to get the current value and then a Set to set the new value. This required a significant amount of refactoring. In adition, a passportSetup.h file contains functions with all the setup code for calling the creates and destroys as well as initilizing the values. A version of passportOffice will run the complete simulation on a single terminal window with a reduced number of entities. A larger version can be used by running all of the required start files as described under the Testing section.

	Multiple Servers:
		The client will randomly pick a server to send a request to. The client will pick a number 0-4 to send the request. If the message fails to send, it will try again up to a certain number of times. This ensures that the contacted server is random and will work correctly with any number of servers 1-5 which are machine id 0-4. When a server recieves a request from a client the server will check to see if it owns the resource. If it does, it can handle the request. Otherwise, such as on a create, the server will add the request to the pending requests table and forward the request to all other active servers. If there are no other active servers, the server will handle the request. When all servers have replied with a 'NO' then the server can handle the request. If any server replies 'YES' then the server will delete the pending request and assume that the server that replied yes will handle it.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ How to test
		Passport Office
			First, run nachos -server -m x where x is any number 0-4. Since I was unable to complete the entire project the passport office will only run properly when a single server is running.

			Option 1: 1 Server and 1 Client
				With one server running, from network/ run nachos -x ../test/passportOffice -m 5 where 5 is any number greater than or equal to 5. This will run a passport office similuation with one of each clerk, 2 customers, and 1 senator.

			Option 2: 1 Server and a bunch of clients
				With one server running, run 1 only of the following from /network/:
					nachos -x ../test/startPassportOffice -m 5
				Wait untill this console outputs "Initialized Passport Office and 1 manager."
				Then in any order run only 1 each:
					nachos -x ../test/startAppClerks -m 6
					nachos -x ../test/startPicClerks -m 7
					nachos -x ../test/startPasClerks -m 8
					nachos -x ../test/startCashiers -m 9
				Wait untill at least one of each clerk as gone on break.
				Then run as many of the following as desired. Stop before a SSN of 200, this is the max. These will run either 8 customers or senators. Once these complete they can be run again and in any order and with any number running concurrently.
					nachos -x ../test/startCustomers -m 10
					nachos -x ../test/startSenators -m 11
				When all customers or senators have finished. To close the office and return resources to the server run:
					nachos -x ../test/stop PassportOffice -m 10

				Note the machine id of all clients do not matter as long as they are unique and not 0-4. The server must have an id 0,1,2,3 or 4.

		Multiple Servers
			While the passport office does not run with multiple servers, locks can be tested with the following. This test creates a number of locks and then does a mutually exclusive 10 second countdown. Unfortunately, DestroyLock isn't complete and the servers will need to be closed to show different lockIDs. There may also be a race condition if the clients call createLock too quickly right now as the server does not check wether a previous request for that name has been made.
				run any number of servers greater than 0 up to 5 with machine ids 0-4.
					nachos -server -m (0-4)
				run any number of the following with a unique non server machine id
					nachos -x ../test/testMultipleServer -m 5

	+ Test Output
		Passport Office
			Option 1:
				The server outputs a large amount of status messages.
				The client will ouput the passport office.
			Option 2:
				The server will output a large amount of status messages.
				The first client will output that the passport office has been initialized and then will output manager messages.
				Each client with output the messages for that entitity.

		Multiple Servers
			Each server will output status messages
			The clients will output the lockID of the value returned from CreateLock and then proceed with a 10 second mutually exclusive countdown.


VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What is supposed to happen.)
		I was expcted to learn about distributed systems and distributed networking. I was to create and convert the passport office to use the networking syscalls and allow for multiple servers.
	+ Experiment result.  (What actually happened.)
		I did learn a great deal about distributed networking. I was able to finish code to enable CreateLock, Release, and Acquire on multiple servers. However, I did not have enough time to get any farther.
	+ Explanation
		I ran out of time to finish the rest of the distributed networking system calls. DestroyLock, CVs, and MVs, all only work while a single server is running. I know how to complete the implementation of these I just do not have enough time. I spent a significant amount of time working on this project over the Thanksgiving break and unfortunately am out of time.

VIII. Miscellaneous:
	I did the entire project on my own, again, this time by choice. Please take into consideration that I am a group of 1. While I did not manage to complete part 2 which is a majority of the points of the project, I did finish part of it so perhaps I could at least get a few points. Sorry for that. Thank you.
